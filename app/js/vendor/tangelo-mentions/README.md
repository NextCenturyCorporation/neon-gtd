# Requirements
For the tangelo-mentions visualization to work, it must be backed by a [Tangelo](http://www.tangelohub.org/tangelo/) server and the server components in the [Tangelo QCR Mentions Prototype](https://github.com/XDATA-Year-3/QCR-mentions-prototype/blob/neon-integration/LICENSE) Tangelo project.

The app/js/vendor/tangelo-mentions/defaults.json file contains the configuration data for the Mentions visualization.
